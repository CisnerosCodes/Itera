# Itera – The Thinking Loop System

Itera is a personal thinking engine — a framework for evolving ideas, mastering topics, and making real progress, powered by structured loops and (optionally) enhanced with AI.

## 🔁 Loop Phases

1. **Prompt** – Define your core question or curiosity
2. **Research** – Gather insights, explore, reflect with or without AI
3. **Reflect** – Summarize what you learned, clarify insights
4. **Act** – Apply what you know: write, build, teach, test

## 💬 Example Use Cases

- Learn a difficult concept (e.g., neural networks, Stoicism)
- Break down a project idea
- Explore a problem space
- Track personal development or goals

## 🚀 How to Use

1. Copy the `/loops` folder
2. Use each phase template inside the loop
3. Paste in one of the provided prompts (inside `.txt` files) into ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini — or just answer them yourself!
4. Keep track of your evolution through the `loop.log`

> Itera works with or without AI. It’s a structure for thinking, not a script to follow.
