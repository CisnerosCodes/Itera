# ðŸŒ€ PROMPT PHASE â€“ Getting Started

Welcome to the start of your loop. This is where you define your curiosity.

## ðŸŽ¯ What is your topic or goal?
Write what you're trying to explore, figure out, or learn. Don't worry about being perfect â€” this is your starting question.

---

## ðŸ§  Suggestions to guide your thinking:

- What triggered this loop? (Was it a conversation, video, question, or assignment?)
- What outcome would make this loop feel "done"?
- Do you want to learn something, solve something, or build something?

## ðŸ§° Advanced Prompting Tips (for AI users)

If you're using an AI like ChatGPT, Claude, or Gemini, here are some ways to structure your questions better.

### ðŸ“¦ Tip 1: Ask the AI to act as something
Example:
> Act as a mentor who helps break down complex ideas for beginners.

### ðŸ§± Tip 2: Use role + task prompts
Example:
> You are a researcher. Help me break down this topic into key questions and subtopics.

### ðŸ”¤ Tip 3: Use JSON formatting for clean responses
Ask your AI:
> Give your response in the following JSON format:
```json
{
  "main_topic": "",
  "subtopics": [],
  "initial_questions": [],
  "related_terms": []
}
```

This helps keep things structured and easy to re-use in later loop phases.
